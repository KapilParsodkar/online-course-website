Introduction
The project’s primary goal is to create a website for instructors across various
domains to publish their courses on their own websites. We will be implementing
the quizzes (if any question gets correct answer, then we increase the question
level), grading a student, showing the report card of the student, when the student
leaves the course, his academic progression will be paused where he left, whenever
the student he resumes the course, his academic progression will be resumed.

prototype and incrementally adding more features in the future.
